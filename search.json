    "text": "Assigned Reading Comparison (\"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures\" and \"To Explain or to Predict?\")\nShmueli’s 2010 article focuses on the problem with the use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power indicate high predictivity. The main purpose of Schmueli’s article “To Explain or to Predict?” is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling. The article clearly defines the terms and provides various examples along with various implications. Schmueli’s main point is how explanation and prediction are often combined instead of distinguishing the two. Furthermore, the article states how the neglect to include predictive modeling and testing along with explanatory modeling is resulting in the loss of testing the importance of existing theories and finding new causal mechanisms.\nBreiman’s 2001 “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” article claims that there are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to draw conclusions from data and accused the statistical modeling community of ignoring algorithmic modeling. Breiman emphasizes that the statistical modeling community is committed to the exclusive usage of data models throughout the entire article. He is not necessarily against data models, however, there are not any rules on what kind of model should be used to solve problems involving data. The main goal of statistics is to use data to predict and get information about the data mechanism according to Breiman.\nIn Shmueli’s 2010 article, she compares the choice of methods for explanatory and predictive modeling. For explanatory modeling, she describes how it requires interpretable statistical models that are easily linked to a theoretical model. On the other hand, predictive modeling is where generating accurate predictions of new observations is often unknown and so the possible methods include both statistical models and data mining algorithms. For predictive modeling, the algorithmic modeling that Breiman highlighted in his article is very suitable!"
